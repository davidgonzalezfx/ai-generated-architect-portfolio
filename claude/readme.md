## Initial Prompts

I am an architect who designs residential and commercial buildings and want to create my own website using HTML, CSS and JS and I want to leverage TailwindCSS styles. My website intend to be my portfolio and will have the next features and pages:

- Responsive design
- Elegant horizontal navbar
- Minimalist Footer including social media links
- Home page: with a hero and a call to action, and then some introduction
- Projects page: Grid to display all projects with thumbnails and short titles
- Project details page
- About me page: that includes a professional bio, profile picture, experience and skills progress bars, awards and publications, client testimonials and contact information
- SEO optimized

Make it look professional as a real website (using correct image URLs, including proper sections, etc)

You will share the HTML, CSS and JS code for each page and I might ask for changes, until I ask you for the next page. Then you will share just the section code as \<head> and navbar and footer will be the same. Start with the home page

游릭 Client testimonials - It genereated two card in the about me page, but I used the following prompts:

```

> something is wrong. I'm see all three texts in a single slide, so when I click to the second slide I see nothing
```
