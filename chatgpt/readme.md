## Initial Prompts

I am an architect who designs residential and commercial buildings and want to create my own website using HTML, CSS and JS and I want to leverage TailwindCSS styles. My website intend to be my portfolio and will have the next features and pages:

- Responsive design
- Elegant horizontal navbar
- Minimalist Footer including social media links
- Home page: with a hero and a call to action, and then some introduction
- Projects page: Grid to display all projects with thumbnails and short titles
- Project details page
- About me page: that includes a professional bio, profile picture, experience and skills progress bars, awards and publications, client testimonials and contact information
- SEO optimized

Make it look professional as a real website (using correct image URLs, including proper sections, etc)

You will share the HTML, CSS and JS code for each page and I might ask for changes, until I ask you for the next page. Then you will share just the section code as \<head> and navbar and footer will be the same. Start with the home page

游릭 Correct Tailwind CSS import

游릭 Responsive navbar - Home | Projects | About Me

游릭 Responsive design - I have to include alpine.js `x-data` to make the navbar responsive, everything else

游릭 Home Layout - I asked to include one more section with two columns for highlighted projects, and got a good layout

游릭 All projects layout - projects section with too small height, so the footer was at the mid of the screen. After one more try I got the correct layout

游릭 Project details - I just replaced the image url, it suggested a unspash url but wasn't showing anything, so I replaced with a valid one

游릭 About me - The layout isn't impressive but it is ok

游릭 Navbar links - index.html, projects.html, about.html and project_1.html href's

游리 Footer icons - svg generated but not so good

游릭 Overall the texts generated appear to be professional. I made minor modification to the unsplash images to make them look more like a real website

游댮 I asked for a carousel in the about me - testimonials section and it was not able to generate it using alpine. None of them work so I just leave the two stacked cards for client testimonials

```
> client testiomnials should be a carousel. Share just the code, no explanations needed
> rewrite the testimonials carousel leveraging alpine.js animations
> alpine.js carousel is not working, rewrite a different one including avatars for clients
```
