# Building an architect portfolio using AI (chat gpt vs anthropic claude vs google gemini)

## Introduction

In this repo, I'm sharing my findings after testing 3 AI tools to help me build an architect portfolio. The tools I tested are ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini. I will share my thoughts on each tool and how they can help me build my portfolio.

游꿢 Go to each AI tool folder to see the code generated as well as my opinion on each tool. Disclaimer: It was my first time building a website only using AI tools and not asking so technical questions, as I acted as a non-developer person. I will keep testing these tools, with more specific propmts and see how they can help me build a real website.

Feel free to suggest a different project than a portfolio website.

## Initial Prompt

I am an architect who designs residential and commercial buildings and want to create my own website using HTML, CSS and JS and I want to leverage TailwindCSS styles. My website intend to be my portfolio and will have the next features and pages:

- Responsive design
- Elegant horizontal navbar
- Minimalist Footer including social media links
- Home page: with a hero and a call to action, and then some introduction
- Projects page: Grid to display all projects with thumbnails and short titles
- Project details page
- About me page: that includes a professional bio, profile picture, experience and skills progress bars, awards and publications, client testimonials and contact information
- SEO optimized

Make it look professional as a real website (using correct image URLs, including proper sections, etc)

You will share the HTML, CSS and JS code for each page and I might ask for changes, until I ask you for the next page. Then you will share just the section code as \<head> and navbar and footer will be the same. Start with the home page

## Conclusion

The three tools generated 100% the same navbar as well as the same color palette without specifying it (white navbar, gray background, blue hero, blue footer). I'm happy with the results of ChatGPT and Anthropic Claude, but I think I will go with Anthropic Claude because it was faster and the layout was more professional. Google Gemini is a good tool, but it generates a lot of placeholders and I had to ask for more details to make it look like a real website.
