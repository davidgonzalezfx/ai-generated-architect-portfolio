## Initial Prompts

I am an architect who designs residential and commercial buildings and want to create my own website using HTML, CSS and JS and I want to leverage TailwindCSS styles. My website intend to be my portfolio and will have the next features and pages:

- Responsive design
- Elegant horizontal navbar
- Minimalist Footer including social media links
- Home page: with a hero and a call to action, and then some introduction
- Projects page: Grid to display all projects with thumbnails and short titles
- Project details page
- About me page: that includes a professional bio, profile picture, experience and skills progress bars, awards and publications, client testimonials and contact information
- SEO optimized

Make it look professional as a real website (using correct image URLs, including proper sections, etc)

You will share the HTML, CSS and JS code for each page and I might ask for changes, until I ask you for the next page. Then you will share just the section code as \<head> and navbar and footer will be the same. Start with the home page

## Google Gemini

游댮 Correct Tailwind CSS import - It worked after 4 tries and when I specified to use cdn.jsdelivr.net

游댮 Responsive navbar - It displays nothing in small screens

游릭 Responsive design

游리 Home layout - At the beginning it only generate a very simple hero and one more section with this text: `I'm a passionate architect with a focus on creating functional and aesthetically pleasing spaces. [Add your personal bio here]` I asked for a more complete version, not a basic structure and it show three progress bars for skills, experience, and creativity, and the footer

游릭 All projects layout - ok 9x9 grid (first show only one project and then I asked for 9) the project descriptions were fine, no images.

游릭 Project details - two columns layout, in the second one it included: overview, project goals, design approach, project outcomes, Sustainability Features, Awards and Recognition, Client Testimonials which is good for inspiration, but all the text were basic placeholders like:

```
Outcome 1: [Quantifiable outcome]
Outcome 2: [Quantifiable outcome]
Outcome 3: [Quantifiable outcome]

"[Client testimonial]"

- Client Name, Client Title
```

游릭 About me - Basic two column layout, nothing impressive, but all the text were placeholders like:

```
**[Job Title]**
[Company Name]
[Dates]
[Key responsibilities and achievements]
```

游댮 Navbar links - all were set to `href="#"` I could ask to fix it, but I was expecting to work by default

游댮 Footer icons - Gemini first suggest it includes a script for font-awesome key, I asked for just the svg icons and it wasn't anything similar to linkedin, instagram and twitter icons

游릭 Time for each response (faster than chat gpt and claude)

游닇 I tought Google Gemini would be more advanced to get images from the internet, so I specified to use images from pexels or unsplash, and despite it is able to generate the link with the correct format, it doesn't bring valid images
